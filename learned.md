# General things

* Man pages probably won't help you conceptually understand a(n) (X)lib
* Drawing things out is still the most useful way for me to debug concepts

# C-specific things

* enums
* unions
* Batshit insane pointer manipulation with for loops
* How #include makes things visible between files based on line of incorporation
* That #defines are pretty nifty
* Assign and check within if statements
* The ternary operator is wonderful
* You can iterate multiple things in a for loop. Why don't they teach us this in school, fuq
* You'll waste time trying to solve things if you don't make sure your Makefile does what you think it does .\_.

# XOrg things

* Mostly how the Xlib Window system works (I found a nice picture somewhere but have lost it, and have not gone looking yet)
* That Xft has no fucking documentation
